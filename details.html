        <h1>About The Dutch Stake Pool</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Stake Pool Operator</h2>
            <p>My name is Damion Seedorf, and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. With 19 years of experience as an IT consultant, I have specialized as a DevOps engineer, focusing on building and maintaining robust IT infrastructures.

                In the blockchain space, I bring extensive experience, having successfully managed a mining farm with 22 GPUs dedicated to Ethereum mining. This hands-on expertise in resource management, hardware optimization, and blockchain technology positions me well for operating a stake pool.
                
                Additionally, I am an active contributor to the Cardano ecosystem. As a Cardano DRep, I represent stakeholders and help drive decentralized decision-making. I also had the honor of serving as a delegate at the Cardano Constitutional Convention, contributing to shaping the future of governance within the ecosystem.
                
                I am passionate about blending my IT expertise and blockchain experience to strengthen and support decentralized networks.</p><br>

            <h2>Other Staking Options</h2>
            <p>When Iagon activates parner staking you can stake your Iagon token to my Iagon node. I will do a 25/75 to 30/70 split.<br>
            I will also be a partner Chain Node/Stake Pool.
